# Page Editor Overview

## Introduction

The Page Editor is a core feature of the Cognityv platform that enables admin users to create and manage application pages. Pages serve as the primary interface for users to interact with business data and execute transactions. The system uses a team-based access control model where pages are always associated with specific teams, and user access is managed through team membership.

# Location Hierarchy System

## What is the goal for the user

Provide users with a structured, hierarchical location system that enables:
- **Organized asset placement** using logical location groupings
- **Scalable location management** from buildings to specific positions
- **Consistent location referencing** across all operations
- **Flexible location organization** to match facility layouts

## What is the user flow

### Understanding the Structure
1. **Learn the hierarchy levels** and their purposes
2. **Identify location components** in your facility
3. **Plan location organization** based on operational needs
4. **Implement consistent naming** across all locations

### Location Setup Process
1. **Define Place Groups**
   - Identify high-level organizational units
   - Create logical groupings (buildings, warehouses, departments)
   - Assign unique identifiers and barcodes

2. **Structure Places**
   - Plan three-level hierarchy for specific locations
   - Define high, mid, and low level components
   - Ensure unique combinations for each location

3. **Generate Location IDs**
   - Combine hierarchy levels into unique identifiers
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Create scannable barcodes for each location

## What is the outcome

### Structured Location System
Users achieve a comprehensive location management system with:

### Place Groups Structure
- **Purpose** - Organize locations into logical top-level groupings
- **Examples** - Buildings, warehouses, facilities, departments
- **Function** - Provide high-level organizational structure
- **Barcode Support** - Each place group has associated scannable barcodes

### Places Structure - Three-Level System
- **High Level** - Building or facility reference
  - Examples: "Building A", "Warehouse 1", "Main Facility"
  - Purpose: Top-level location identification
  
- **Mid Level** - Floor, section, zone, or area
  - Examples: "Floor 4", "Section B", "Loading Dock"
  - Purpose: Intermediate location specification
  
- **Low Level** - Specific position, shelf, or spot number
  - Examples: "Position 5", "Shelf 12", "Bay 3"
  - Purpose: Precise location identification

### Location Referencing System
- **Unique Identification** - Combination of all three levels creates unique location ID
- **Format** - `High Level + Mid Level + Low Level`
- **Example** - "Building A 4 5" (Building A, Floor 4, Position 5)
- **Barcode Integration** - Each complete location has scannable barcode

### Benefits
- **Scalable Organization** - Supports facilities of any size
- **Logical Structure** - Matches real-world facility layouts
- **Unique Identification** - Every location has distinct identifier
- **Operational Efficiency** - Quick location identification and navigation
- **Consistent Referencing** - Standardized location naming across system

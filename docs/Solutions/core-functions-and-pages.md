# Core Functionality

## Overview

Transactions are the lifeblood of any business operation, and Cognityv is designed around this fundamental principle. Every business process—from procurement and sales to manufacturing and finance—is driven by transactions that capture, process, and track critical business activities in real-time.

The core functionality of Cognityv is organized into specialized pages where users can define, configure, and execute these essential transactions. Each functional area provides dedicated interfaces and workflows that enable businesses to manage their operations efficiently while maintaining complete visibility and control over their processes.

These transaction-driven pages serve as the operational command centers for different departments, allowing users to:
- Define business rules and workflows specific to their needs
- Execute transactions with built-in validation and approval processes
- Monitor progress and performance through integrated reporting
- Maintain audit trails and compliance documentation
